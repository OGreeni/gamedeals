## What is GameDeals?
GameDeals is a simple web app, built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB. It compares prices of video games across multiple online providers.

## How is the data gathered?
The game data was gathered using the public CheapShark API. You can learn more about it [here](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/).
The API ensures that the prices are always accurate and updated.

## Get notified of sales through email
You can opt in to the CheapShark API subscription list to get notified every time a game goes on sale. Once you are authenticated, this can be done through the account page of the app.
